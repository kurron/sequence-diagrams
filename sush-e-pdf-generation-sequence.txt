title Sush-E PDF Generation Sequence

note left of Sush-E
    use of PUT is to indicate idempotency
    we probably want to use an asynchronous model to deal with latency
    
    1) embedded assets are placed into temporary storage
    2) data blob references those assets
    3) data blob and template are combined into a PDF
    4) resulting PDF is placed into temporary storage for pickup
